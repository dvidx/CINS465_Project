Homepage:
Just shows one box for each event.
Searchbox was intended to filter boxes. But function not realized. Currently only logs searchvalue and box div element.

Map:
Shows all events on Map. (Sometimes it doesn't load any markers. There is an console error. Reloading page once or twice fixes issue)
Geolocation doesn't work on hosted Server because of HTTP.
To create an event click on any point on the map to open form. (Form should only show, when logged in)

Chat:
Very basic. Only able to send message to "chatroom". (Only viewable when logged in)

Events:
Shows tickets offered and option to bid. No control of entered value.
Other option to create an offer for a ticket.
